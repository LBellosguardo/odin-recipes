    <p>We tweaked this from several stuffed pepper recipes to come up with a yummy version that tastes even better reheated for lunch the next day. This is a great side dish with fish. You could use vegetable broth to make it vegetarian.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 red bell peppers</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1 onion</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 can (16 ounce) diced tomatoes, drained and juice reserved</li>
            <li>1 cup chicken broth</li>
            <li>3/4 cup quinoa</li>
            <li>1/2 carrot, grated</li>
            <li>1 can (14 ounce) black beans</li>
            <li>1 package (6 oz) fresh spinach, or more to taste</li>
            <li>1/2 cup shredded Mexican cheese blend</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>

            <li>Roast peppers in the preheated oven until tender, about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion until softened, 5 to 10 minutes. Add garlic, cumin, salt, and black pepper to onion; cook and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute more.</li>
            <li>Mix tomatoes, chicken broth, quinoa, and carrot into onion mixture; cook until quinoa is tender, about 12 minutes. Stir black beans and spinach into quinoa mixture, adding reserved tomato juice if mixture is dry. Spoon quinoa mixture into roasted red peppers and top with Mexican cheese blend.</li>
            <li>Bake in the oven until cheese is melted, about 15 minutes.</li>
