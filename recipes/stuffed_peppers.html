      We tweaked this from several stuffed pepper recipes to come up with a
      yummy version that tastes even better reheated for lunch the next day.
      This is a great side dish with fish. You could use vegetable broth to make
      it vegetarian.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>3 red bell peppers</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
      <li>1 onion</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 can (16 ounce) diced tomatoes, drained and juice reserved</li>
      <li>1 cup chicken broth</li>
      <li>3/4 cup quinoa</li>
      <li>1/2 carrot, grated</li>
      <li>1 can (14 ounce) black beans</li>
      <li>1 package (6 oz) fresh spinach, or more to taste</li>
      <li>1/2 cup shredded Mexican cheese blend</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking
        dish and arrange red bell peppers in dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Roast peppers in the preheated oven until tender, about 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion until
        softened, 5 to 10 minutes. Add garlic, cumin, salt, and black pepper to
        onion; cook and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute more.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix tomatoes, chicken broth, quinoa, and carrot into onion mixture; cook
        until quinoa is tender, about 12 minutes. Stir black beans and spinach
        into quinoa mixture, adding reserved tomato juice if mixture is dry.
        Spoon quinoa mixture into roasted red peppers and top with Mexican
        cheese blend.
      </li>
      <li>Bake in the oven until cheese is melted, about 15 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
